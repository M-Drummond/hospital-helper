make me a system for a hospital that allows for nurses to create patients and admit them to beds. They should be able to add and remove patients from beds, and they should be able to add or remove new beds in the system without deleting patient data. They should be able to add, edit or delete notes for a patient, but nurses should not be able to edit or delete notes from other nurses. You should also supply documentation for any configuration on how to run it
